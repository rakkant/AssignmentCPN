# For Running a front-end side (client folder)
npm start

# For Running a back-end side (server folder)
npm start


## Scalability
- I have made this code connected to Firebase for increasing the scalability of the code, however, I remove the key file due to the security issue.
- I have created a load-balancer file as well.

## Security
- There are error handlers in the code.
- Security middleware is applied

## Testable
- There are unit tests for the code both in front-end and back-end side
  
## Microservices
- Backend and Front-end components are separated, as well as the database usage.

## RESTFUL API
- I have used the RESTFUL API for the back-end side. (POST/ GET / DELETE)

* UI may not beautiful, but I also realized see what to improve
